Vulnerability title: Wordpress Geo Mashup plugin XSS
Author: Paolo Perego
CVE: CVE-2015-1383
Affected versions: <= 1.8.2
Fixed version: 1.8.3 (January, 11 2015)
Product link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/geo-mashup/

Description
Geo Mashup is a wordpress plugin  designed to let you save location
information with posts, pages, and other WordPress objects. These
information can then be presented on interactive maps in many ways.
Plugin versions before 1.8.3 suffer from a cross site scripting
vulnerability when displaying search results. The search key was not
properly sanitized so an attacker can eventually inject arbitrary
javascript code.

Fix
People can use Wordpress backend provided functionalities to upgrade
Wordpress Geo Mashup plugin to the latest version.
