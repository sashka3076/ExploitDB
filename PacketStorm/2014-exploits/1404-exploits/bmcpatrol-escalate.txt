CVE: CVE-2014-2591
Vendor: BMC
Product: Patrol for AIX
Affected version: 3.9.00

that means they searched for libraries in insecure locations.

SUIDFILE='/product/bmc/Patrol3/AIX6.1.0.0-64/best1/9.0.00/bgs/bin/bgscollect' SUIDFILELS='-r-sr-sr-x 1 root system 8745125 Apr 03 2012 /product/bmc/Patrol3/AIX6.1.0.0-64/best1/9.0.00/bgs/bin/bgscollect' RPATH='' RPATHRELATIVE=yes RPATHLS=N/A RAPTHEXISTS=N/A ISBAD=yes
       
An attacker could place a malicious library in one of the affected
directories, which would then be loaded when the affected program is
run, leading to privilege escalation in instances where the program runs
with privileges that the attacker does not have.
