is able to steal or manipulate an active session and use it to gain
unathorized access to the application.

[Vulnerability Type]

Session hijacking

=====================================================================

[Example scenario]

We are using two users to explain it:

- [DEMO1] = Locked user

- [DEMO2] = Normal user

The [DEMO1] has been locked to the system and we are using the [DEMO2]
session to try to unlock the [DEMO1] user but we canA't because we donA't
have this privileges so this is correct like you can see in this screenshot.

The session hijacking occurs when we use the old session that we had used
with [DEMO1] user before lock it.
This session hasnA't been deleted/expired so you can it to unlock the
[DEMO1] user without problem like you can see in the next evidence.
