Subject: ordinary users bringing NT to its knees [repost]

[Aleph, sorry about my original post - I pasted the wrong code! oops! :) ]

Hi,

sorry if problems like this are known, but I thought I'd post this just
incase...

I was curious at how well NT could handle *lots* of threads, so I wrote the
following. It basically locks up the system with an inability to kill the
process because (I) never get the task manager up. Pretty bad since an
ordinary user can run it :/

my system: 2xPPro with NT4 (SP5), 128megs RAM.

cheers

        This is just an exploit for the 'neverending quantum' bug that's been known
for ages. See http://www.sysinternals.com/tips.htm#NEQuantum It has nothing
to do with the number of threads running (except that you need at least one
per CPU).

        The bug occurs when a thread changes its priority. NT changes the thread's
priority, but also gives it a new execution quantum. By repeating this
process, a single thread can monopolize a CPU.

<http://www.sysinternals.com/tips.htm#NEQuantum>

Never-ending Quantum? 
                 
In NT, as with most time-sharing operating systems, threads run in turns called 
quantums. Normally, a thread executes until its quantum runs out. The next time 
it is scheduled it starts with a full quantum. However, in NT a thread also gets 
its quantum refreshed every time its thread or process priority is set. This 
means that a thread can reset its quantum by calling SetThreadPriority (without 
changing its priority) before its turn runs out. If it continues to do this it 
will effectively have an infinite quantum.  Why does NT do this? Its not clear, 
but it appears to be a bug.
