Subject:      Linux blind TCP spoofing, act II + others
To: BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM 


Hello,
Thanks to libnids development, some features/bugs in Linux kernel were found.
I notified kernel mantainers in May, but they didn't seem interested.


1. Blind TCP spoofing against 2.0.36/37
        Let's label a Linux server as A, an attacker's host as B, the spoofed
host as C. If the following conditions hold:


a) C is down (disabled)
b) A is idle; more precisely, during the attack A should not send any
   packets beside ones generated in response to the packets sent by B
c) during the attack, no packet sent from B to A can be dropped by a router


then an attacker can spoof a TCP stream connecting A and C.
        As we see, these conditions are not trivial. However, b) and c) can
hold if an attack is conducted during low network traffic period; and there
are ways to fulfill a) :)
        Firstly, let's have a look how Linux 2.0.x reacts to a non-typical
TCP segment sent as a third packet of a three way handshake. In the example
below we send to a Linux server (A) packets from B with source address set to
C.
Time        packets with forged source address    packets sent by the server
0             flags=S,seq=X
1                                              flags=SA,seq=Y,ack_seq=X+1
2             flags=A,seq=X+1, ack_seq=Y-1000
3                                                no packet generated !
4             flags=A,seq=X+1,ack_seq=Y+1000
5                                               flags=R,seq=Y+1000
                                                a packet IS generated !
6             flags=A,seq=X+1,ack_seq=Y+1
7                                               flags=A,seq=Y+1,ack_seq=X+1
                                         socket enters "established" state
8             flags=A,seq=X+1,ack_seq=Y+1000
9                                                no packet sent !


        So, when an attacker sends (as a third packet of tcp handshake) a
packet with too small ack_seq, the server sends no packets (doesn't it
violate RFC793 ?). When a packet with too big ack_seq is sent, the server
sends a packet (with a reset flag).
        Now let's recall another Linux feature. Many OSes (including Linux)
assign to ID field of an outgoing IP datagram consecutive, increasing
numbers (we forget about fragmentation here; irrelevant in this case). That
enables anyone to determine the number of packets sent by host A: it's enough
to ping it, note the value of ID field of received ICMP_REPLY packet, wait x
seconds (or perform some other actions), then again ping host A. The
difference between ID fields of received ICMP_REPLY packets is equal to (the
number of packets sent by A in x second) +1. "Idle portscan" by antirez uses
this technique.
        Having sent an initial TCP segment with SYN flag, our attack will
consist of a set of "probes". In each probe, we send a (forged) TCP packet
with flags=A and (arbitrary) ack_seq=X, then we send an ICMP_ECHO request, and
finally note the ID field of received ICMP_REPLY packet. If this ID field has
incremented by 1 since the last time, only one packet were sent by server
(ICMP_REPLY), so we must have chosen too small X (that is, ack_seq). If ID
field has incremented by 2, two packes were sent (TCP with reset flag and
ICMP_REPLY), so we must have chosen too big ack_seq. This way we can perform
a binary search in space of ack_seq's, determining exact ack_seq after at most
32 probes. Note that finding correct ack_seq can be verified by sending a
probe with previously found too big ack_seq; if connection is in "established"
state, no packet will be generated by server.
        After we have found the Holy Graal of blind spoofers, the correct
value of ack_seq, nothing will prevent us from completing 3whs and sending
arbitrary data.
        At the end of this post I enclosed an exploit; don't use it without
the permission of the target host's admin. I tested it on 2.0.37, 36 and 30;
probably all 2.0.x are affected. It requires libnet (which can be downloaded
from www.packetfactory.net). I compiled it on Linux glibc system. The
following simple patch (against 2.0.37) enforces sending a reset in response
to a packet with too small ack_seq (of course, only when we are in SYN_RECV
state). This patch also cures the bug described in point 3.

2. A byte of urgent data can be received in normal data stream. Let's
consider the following scenario:
Time              Client app             Server app
0                                     bind(...), listen(...), accept(...)
1                 connect(...)
2                                     accept(...) returns newsock
3      send(sockfd,"AB",2,MSG_OOB)
4      send(sockfd,"XY",2,MSG_OOB)
5                                     n=read(newsock,buffer,1024)


function read returns 3, buffer contains "ABX", though byte 'B' was marked
as urgent. Verified with 2.0.37 and 2.2.9-ac1, probably all versions are
vulnerable. Note that this behaviour can be exploited to bypass NIDS.


3. Weird handling of 3rd stage of TCP handshake.


Time        packets sent by a client        packets sent by a server
0          flags=S,seq=X
1                                         flags=SA,seq=Y,ack_seq=X+1
2 flags=A,seq=X+1,ack_seq=Y-4,data="xyz"
3                                        flags=A,seq=Y+1,ack_seq=X+4
                                           no data is returned to app
4                                        flags=SA,seq=Y+1,ack_seq=X+4
5 flags=A,seq=X+1,ack_seq=Y+1,data="1234567"
6                                        flags=A,seq=Y+1,ack_seq=X+8
                                          app receives "4567"
which is inconsitent. Either the packet sent in time 2 should be discarded and
app should receive "1234567", or app should receive "xyz4567" .
Verified on 2.0.36, 2.2.x behaves correctly (sends reset in time 3).
Usually it is not a problem, but IDS developers can be worried.
