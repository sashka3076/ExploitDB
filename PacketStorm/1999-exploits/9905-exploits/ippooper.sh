# iParty Pooper by Ka-wh00t (wh00t@iname.com) - early May '99 - Created out of pure boredom.
# iParty is a cute little voice conferencing program still widely used (much to my surprise.)
# Unfortuneately, the daemon, that's included in the iParty download, can be shut down remotely.
# And in some circumstances, this can lead to other Windows screw-ups (incidents included internet
# disconnection, ICQ GPFs, Rnaapp crashes, etc.) Sometimes the daemon closes quietly, other times
# a ipartyd.exe GPF. DoSers will hope for the GPF. At time of this script's release, the latest
# (only?) version of iParty/iPartyd was v1.2
# FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
